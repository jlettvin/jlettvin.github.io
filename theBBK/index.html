				If we have AI, why do we need a Brain Building Kit?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 1:
				What are you trying to do?
				Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>AI is the sizzle.  Synthetic Reflexes is the steak</li>
				<li>The sizzle of intelligence is seductive and well-funded BUT</li>
				<li class="hi">reflexes are what keep everything running</li>
				<li>All we do is reflex
					<i>(both The BBK and actual brains)</i>
				</li>

				Why Are Nervous Systems Hard?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 2:
				How is it done today,
				and what are the limits of current practice?
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>No simple model neurons exist</li>
				<li>AI models speculations about complex functions</li>
				<li>So do HTM, neural nets, and neuromorphic engineering</li>
				<li>All successfully solve high-value problems BUT</li>
				<li class="hi">All rely on the old limited cybernetic model neuron</li>
			</ul>

				Novel IP developed over 16 years.
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 3:
				What is new in your approach
				and why do you think it will be successful?
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Modeling reflexes is easier than modeling intelligence</li>
				<li>The BBK is an elementary remodeling of sensorimotor systems</li>
				<li class="hi">It emulates materials from nano to macro scale</li>
				<li>Simple discrete assemblable elements emerged</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Motor organs like skeletal and mollusc muscles</li>
					<li>Sensor organs like eyes, ears, skin, and chemical</li>
					<li>Interneuron organs to transform sensory to motor</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Operations appear to have economies similar to in-vivo</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The design has naturally efficient operations (low energy)</li>
					<li>The design has natural redundant recovery from injury</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Discrete component internals resemble those of living organs</li>
				<li>Simple demonstration reflex systems are being planned</li>
				<li class="hi">If you build a thing, you might understand it</li>
			</ul>

				Where can The BBK be deployed?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 4:
				Who cares?
				If you are successful, what difference will it make?
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Robots can have fine complex life-like reflexes</li>
				<li>Processes can respond to conditions without intervention</li>
				<li>Avatars can respond to game players like living creatures</li>
				<li>Prostheses can behave like natural limbs</li>
				<li class="hi">All this without a line of customizing code</li>
				<li>Individual discrete components have strategic value
					<ul>
						<li>Heavy lift high power synthetic muscles</li>
						<li>Highly integrated 3D camera with proximity alarm</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Valuable new insights for clinical neurologists
					<ul>
						<li>Confirmable speculations on in-vivo mechanisms</li>
						<li>Identifiable lesion-to-symptom prediction</li>
						<li>Retrainable optional pathway identification</li>
					</ul>

				What is left to do?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 5: What are the risks?</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>We are constructing a first demonstration robot</li>
				<li>There are some bridging concepts still under development
					<ul>
						<li>Synthetic muscle is being refined</li>
						<li>Synthetic eye is being refined</li>
						<li>Synthetic midbrain is being refined</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hi">A staff is needed to complete development</li>
				<li>The IP has not yet been protected, but is patentable</li>

				How much will it cost
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 6: How much will it cost?</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Appropriate salaries, overhead, and other business costs</li>
				<li>Patent fees</li>
				<li class="hi">Likely initial launch costs are about $5M</li>
				<li>Ramp up after initial demonstration should be about $20M</li>

				How long will it take?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 7: How long will it take?</aside>
			<ul>
				<li class="hi">A gifted staff could produce a demo in 6 months</li>
				<li>A usable BBK for retrofitting an existing robot could take 1 year</li>
				<li>The forward opportunities make the potential limitless</li>

				<li>Processes cam juggle limitless parameters to achieve efficiency</li>
				<li>Avatars can make game characters respond naturally</li>
				<li>Prostheses can feel like natural extensions of "self"</li>
				<li>New conditions and skills are easily trained</li>

				<li>Nociception (noxious stimulus awareness) is natural</li>
				<li>Coordination follows transform rules native to neural organs</li>
				<li>Both sensing and motion achieve "sub-voxel" refinement</li>
				<li class="hi">The whole point is to make it all feel natural</li>

				Synthetic Reflexes is NOT Artificial Intelligence
			</summary>
			<ul>
				<li>However, nervous systems are layered reflex systems</li>
				<li>Higher functions may emerge from layering</li>
				<li>We do not hope to compete with AI</li>
				<li class="hi">We hope to make the human/machine interface more natural</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Historical accounts of neurons are rich with unused content</li>

				<li>We found more than a few principles unknown by practitioners</li>
				<li>We have applied engineering principles to put it all together</li>
