				If we have AI, why do we need a Brain Building Kit?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 1:
				What are you trying to do?
				Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>AI is the sizzle.  Synthetic Reflexes is the steak</li>
				<li>The sizzle of intelligence is seductive and well-funded BUT</li>
				<li class="hi">reflexes are what keep everything running</li>
				<li>All we do is reflex
					<i>(both The BBK and actual brains)</i>

				Why Are Nervous Systems Hard?
			</summary>
			<aside>Heilmeier 2:
				How is it done today,
				and what are the limits of current practice?
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>No simple model neurons exist</li>
				<li>AI models speculations about complex functions</li>
				<li>So do HTM, neural nets, and neuromorphic engineering</li>
				<li>All successfully solve high-value problems BUT</li>
				<li class="hi">All rely on the old limited cybernetic model neuron</li>

				Novel IP developed over 16 years.

			<aside>Heilmeier 3:
				What is new in your approach
				and why do you think it will be successful?
			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Modeling reflexes is easier than modeling intelligence</li>
				<li>The BBK is an elementary remodeling of sensorimotor systems</li>
				<li class="hi">It emulates materials from nano to macro scale</li>
				<li>Simple discrete assemblable elements emerged</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Motor organs like skeletal and mollusc muscles</li>
					<li>Sensor organs like eyes, ears, skin, and chemical</li>
					<li>Interneuron organs to transform sensory to motor</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Operations appear to have economies similar to in-vivo</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The design has naturally efficient operations (low energy)</li>
					<li>The design has natural redundant recovery from injury</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Discrete component internals resemble those of living organs</li>
				<li>Simple demonstration reflex systems are being planned</li>
				<li class="hi">If you build a thing, you might understand it</li>

			</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Robots can have fine complex life-like reflexes</li>
				<li>Processes can respond to conditions without intervention</li>
				<li>Avatars can respond to game players like living creatures</li>

			<aside>Heilmeier 5: What are the risks?</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>We are constructing a first demonstration robot</li>
				<li>There are some bridging concepts still under development
					<ul>
						<li>Synthetic muscle is being refined</li>
						<li>Synthetic eye is being refined</li>
						<li>Synthetic midbrain is being refined</li>

			<aside>Heilmeier 6: How much will it cost?</aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Appropriate salaries, overhead, and other business costs</li>

				Potential Uses
			</summary>
			<aside></aside>
			<ul>
				<li>Flying Personal Exoskeleton (Be a Bird!)
					<details>
						A shoulder harness.with bird-like wings
						powered by a Lithium Battery and a BBK
						to endow it with intrinsic flight reflexes.
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>Waldos
					<details>
						As Heinlein wrote in his eponymous short story
						a swiss army knife of robotic arms with
						intrinsic reflexes for a variety of skills
						can simplify currently difficult tasks.
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>Rescue Mission TelePresence Robots
					<details>
						During a disease outbreak or nuclear accident
						the ability to project the abilities of skilled personnel
						while remaining safely remote can be implemented.
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>Game Characters with Unique On-The-Fly Experience
					<details>
						The characters in the game you play adapt to you.
						You have to go mano-y-mano with an avatar which
						figures out what you are doing and discovers
						new ways to attach you, in particular.
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>Market Dynamics Analyst
					<details>
						Discovery of associable characteristics
						is a skill often thought to require
						a thinking person to achieve.
						However, pattern discovery is the principle feature
						of reflex systems.
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>Toy BBK Robot for Children
					<details>
						Learning the basics of reflex systems and
						how to assemble and train them can be made
						accessible to children old enough to use
						erector sets or similar construction toys.
